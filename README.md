# Biosignal Processing Notebooks Repository

Welcome to the **Biosignal Processing Notebooks Repository**. This repository contains a collection of Python notebooks I have developed for processing and analyzing various biosignals such as EEG (Electroencephalogram), EMG (Electromyogram), and R-peaks from ECG (Electrocardiogram) data. These notebooks are designed to provide a comprehensive toolkit for biosignal analysis and are suitable for both educational and research purposes.
## Requirements

To use these notebooks, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- NumPy
- SciPy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- MNE (for EEG processing)
- PyEMD (for empirical mode decomposition, if needed)
- Other libraries as specified in the notebook headers

## Features
* EEG Processing: Includes filtering, epoch extraction, and frequency analysis.
* EMG Analysis: Covers preprocessing, signal rectification, and feature extraction.
* R-Peak Detection: Provides algorithms for detecting R-peaks in ECG data, along with heart rate variability analysis.
* Data Visualization: Tools for visualizing time-series data and signal features.

## Acknowledgements
While these notebooks and scripts were developed by me, they were inspired by the teachings and resources from various experts in the field of biomedical signal processing in SUPSI university.
